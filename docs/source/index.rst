: On-FPGA profiling tool for HLS designs

Welcome to RealProbe, the on-FPGA profiling tool designed for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs. By simply adding :guilabel: `#pragma HLS RealProbe` to your code, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of how your HLS designs perform on FPGA hardware, including detailed insights into all sub-modules, function calls, and loops.


Features
----------------

Fully Automated
    RealProbe is the first end-to-end profiler from HLS source code to bitstream generation and on-FPGA execution. 
    All profiling process operates with zero user manual effort.

Easy integration
    RealProbe is fully integrated into Vitis HLS and Vivado toolchain, 
    no extra environment settings, tool installations, or dependencies are required.

Open source
    RealProbe is publicly accessible and continuously developed and maintained for ongoing improvement and support.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
