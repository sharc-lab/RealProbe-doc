FCCM 2024 Tutorial
========

Welcome! This is the tutorial for `The 32nd IEEE International Symposium On Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM)<https://www.fccm.org/>`_.

Our Tutorial Name is "Understanding Your FPGA Design Better: From Rapid Simulation to On-board Profiling"
This page is for the second half of tutorial, about RealProbeüîç. If you are interested in first half of tutorial about ‚ö°LightningSim, a ultra-fast, accurate, trace-based simulator for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs, check out `LightningSim Tutorial <https://lightningsim-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html>`_ page.

RealProbe is a fully automated on-board profiling tool designed to extract real on-FPGA performance simply by annotating the HLS source code. We will go through step-by-step introducing RealProbe and its usage with hands-on examples.
