"Understanding Your FPGA Design Better: From Rapid Simulation to On-board Profiling"

Understanding FPGA design performance is crucial for optimizing designs and meeting performance targets. 

Performance is evaluated in two ways: simulated in terms of cycle count, and measured on-board in terms of latency/throughput. Both are challenging to obtain accurately and efficiently, largely hindering FPGA design optimizations.

Part 1: Simulated performance (LightningSim)
>> :underline:'Part 2: Measured performance (RealProbe)'

Schedule: 1:40 pm — 3:00 pm
   1:40 – 1:50: Introduction to the RealProbe tool
   1:50 – 2:40: Hands-on experiments using RealProbe
   2:40 – 3:00: Discussion and closing
