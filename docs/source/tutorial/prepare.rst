Setup 
==============================

This tutorial system setup has been provided by Dr. Jeff Young from `Center for Research into Novel Compute Hierarchies <https://crnch.gatech.edu/>`_ at Georgia Tech.

We will be using `Synestia Desktop <https://synestia-ood.cc.gatech.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/synestia_desktop/session_contexts/new/>`_ for interacting with tools, and `Synestia Pynq Z2 FPGA <https://synestia-ood.cc.gatech.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/pynq_jupyter/session_contexts/new>`_ for interacting with FPGA boards.
